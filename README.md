**Do you know what your words mean to anybody?**

Fuzzy Octo Waffle is a simple machine learning system that utilizes pre-trained BiLSTM neural network models, trained on both English and self-created Ukrainian datasets, to perform emotion analysis.

## Overview

This repository, created for a bachelor's diploma project, provides a straightforward ML application in two main versions:

- **Google Colaboratory Version**: Leverages Google Colab for training, validating, and using emotion analysis models, utilizing Googleâ€™s resources.
- **Local Version**: Utilizes Gradio for the interface. This version allows the usage of pre-trained models but does not support training new models.

## Features

- **Pre-trained BiLSTM Models**: Access pre-trained models for emotion analysis in both English and Ukrainian.
- **Dual Deployment**: Choose between Google Colab for full model training and local deployment for quick model inference.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with Gradio for local deployment.

## Installation

### Local Version

1. **Download and Extract**: Download this repository as an archive and extract it to your desired location on your PC.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the extracted folder and run the `Install.bat` file to install all required libraries.
3. **Launch Application**: After successful installation, run `launch_main.bat` and wait for the Gradio interface to launch at `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`.

### Google Colab Version

1. **Download Repository**: Download this repository as an archive and extract it to your desired location on your PC.
2. **Upload Files to Google Drive**: Upload the three files from the `colab` folder to your Google Drive.
3. **Follow Instructions**: Open the uploaded files and follow the instructions provided for usage.

## Datasets

- **English Model**: Trained on the [Emotions Dataset for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp) from Kaggle.
- **Ukrainian Model**: Self-created dataset consisting of 200k+ labeled words categorized as "negative" or "positive". Feel free to use this dataset and credit me in your project.
